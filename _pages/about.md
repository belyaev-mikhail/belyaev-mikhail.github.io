## Who am I?

My name is Mikhail and I write stuff, program stuff and teach stuff.
In particular, I teach university students and do things for Jetbrains Research at the program analysis and verification lab.

I also know stuff about program analysis and verification, quite a number of programming languages and software engineering in general.
Right now I'm quite fixed on Kotlin and stuff around it.

## What is this site for?

Mostly for long-writes in English that don't fit into a tweet.
Technical notes, Kotlin stuff, my thoughts on programming, life and everything.

## What is this site not for?

My personal thoughts and feelings on non-technical stuff.
I have other social media for that.
This may change in the future.

## What do I do?

Quite a number of things, actually.
